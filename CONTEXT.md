# Context for Next Agent - Iteration 39 Complete

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully added **modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml** (PEP 517/518 compliance).

### Issue Addressed
- Project only had legacy setup.py for packaging
- Missing modern pyproject.toml standard (PEP 517/518)
- This affects tooling support and future-proofing

### Changes Made
**File: `pyproject.toml` (NEW)**
- Added PEP 517/518 compliant build configuration
- Declared build system requirements (setuptools>=45, wheel)
- Migrated all metadata from setup.py to declarative format
- Added Python 3.13 classifier (already supported, just not declared)
- Configured optional dependencies (full, dev)
- Added project URLs (homepage, bug reports, source)
- Used setuptools build backend for compatibility

### Why This Approach
- **PEP 517/518 Standard**: Modern Python packaging uses pyproject.toml
- **Tool Support**: Better integration with pip, build, poetry, and other tools
- **Declarative Config**: Cleaner than imperative setup.py
- **Future-Proof**: setup.py is being phased out by the Python community
- **Backward Compatible**: Kept setup.py for now to maintain compatibility
- **Single Source**: pyproject.toml becomes the authoritative source for metadata

### Technical Details
**Build System:**
- Uses setuptools as build backend (most compatible)
- Requires setuptools>=45 and wheel
- No dynamic versioning (static 0.1.0 for simplicity)

**Package Configuration:**
- All metadata moved from setup.py
- Python 3.7+ requirement maintained
- Optional dependencies preserved (psutil, pytest)
- Package discovery simplified

### Testing Results
✅ Package builds successfully with `python -m build`
✅ Wheel installs correctly (`pip install dist/amorsize-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`)
✅ All 630 tests passing (26 skipped)
✅ Zero warnings maintained
✅ No regressions - all functionality preserved

### Build Verification
```bash
# Clean build
python3 -m build --wheel --no-isolation
# Successfully built amorsize-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Install and test
pip install dist/amorsize-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
python3 -c "from amorsize import optimize; print('✓ Works')"
```

### Status
✅ Production ready - Modern packaging infrastructure in place

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **CI/CD Automation** (HIGH VALUE) - Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and building
2. Advanced tuning (Bayesian optimization)
3. Profiling integration (cProfile, flame graphs)
4. Pipeline optimization (multi-function)
5. Documentation improvements (API reference, advanced guides)

## Notes for Next Agent
The codebase is in **EXCELLENT** shape with enhanced packaging:

### Infrastructure (The Foundation) ✅
- ✅ Physical core detection with multiple fallback strategies
- ✅ Memory limit detection (cgroup/Docker aware)
- ✅ Measured spawn cost (not estimated - actual benchmarks)
- ✅ **Modern Python packaging (pyproject.toml - PEP 517/518)**

### Safety & Accuracy (The Guardrails) ✅
- ✅ Generator safety with `itertools.chain` 
- ✅ OS spawning overhead actually measured
- ✅ Comprehensive pickle checks (function + data)

### Core Logic (The Optimizer) ✅
- ✅ Full Amdahl's Law implementation
- ✅ Chunksize based on 0.2s target duration
- ✅ Memory-aware worker calculation

### UX & Robustness (The Polish) ✅
- ✅ Edge cases handled (empty data, unpicklable, etc.)
- ✅ Clean API (`from amorsize import optimize`)
- ✅ Python 3.7-3.13 compatibility (declared in pyproject.toml)
- ✅ Zero warnings in test suite
- ✅ **Modern packaging with pyproject.toml**

### Key Enhancement
**pyproject.toml adds:**
- PEP 517/518 compliance for modern Python packaging
- Better tooling integration (pip, build, poetry)
- Declarative configuration (easier to maintain)
- Future-proof approach as setup.py is being phased out
- Python 3.13 officially declared as supported

All foundational work is complete. The **highest-value next increment** would be:
- **CI/CD Automation**: Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, linting, and package building on PR/push
- This provides continuous validation and prepares for PyPI publication

Good luck! 🚀
